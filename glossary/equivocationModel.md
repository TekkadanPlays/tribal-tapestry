The equivication model of logical fallacy 
=====

The equivication model of logical fallacy holds that most, if not all, logical fallacies can be understood in terms of the strategic application of dishonest equivocation.

### Categorization of logical fallacies

There is currently no accepted model for categorization or enumeratinon logical fallacies. (citation???) Note that (citation 1) enumerates X fallacies, while (citation 2) enumerates Y fallacies. (Can this statement be supported???)

According to the cortical tapestry model of knowledge representation and curation, one of the essential functions of the concept graph is to enumerate multiple definitions for any given word, phrase, concept or idea, and the central function of the grapevine is to pick one of them for any given context. From the viewpoint of this model, it shouold come as no surprise that equivocation would play a fundamental role in construction of toxic threads for use in construction of a narrative fiction.

### Equivocation network

Toxic tribal threaded tapestries typically contain multiple dishonest equivocations (DEs). A well formed narrative fiction contains multiple interlinking dishoonest equovactions. A useful exercise would be to map out the topology of DEs for a narrative fiction such as contemporary wokism. DEs will be arranged strategically in a way that it takes considerable effort to pin down the fallacy. Trying to do so becomes like a game of whack-a-mole.

Consider a tapestry with two DEs: DE_i and DE_j. Each DE contains two definitions: [DE_i_1, DE_i_2] and [DE_j_1, DE_j_2]. These DEs may be said to be *interlinked* if DE_i_1 is logically consistent with DE_j_1 but not DE_j_2, and vice versa. Now consider a fallacious argument (one that is held dear by the narrative fiction) that can be contrued in either of two ways: through the use of DE_i_1 and DE_j_2, or through the use of DE_i_2 and DE_j_1. In each case, the pair of definitions are logically incompatible. However, the argument is typically stated so that the individual rarely considers both definitions at the same time. If a challenger wishes to attack the argument, for example by challenging the definition of DE_i, the defender of the tribal narrative has several options: vacillate the definitions of DE_i and DE_j in a way to maintain consistency between the definitions (but ot admitting that the entire argument fails if so chosen); or accusing the attacker of pedantry. 

### Examples

TODO: take some standard logical fallacies and explain them in terms of equivocation.

### More in depth categorization

Equivocation can be used to create something that could be described as a *periodic table of logical fallacies*. (Can this idea be developed??)
