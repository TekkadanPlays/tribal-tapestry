The equivication model of logical fallacy 
=====

The equivication model of logical fallacy holds that most, if not all, logical fallacies can be understood in terms of the strategic application of dishonest equivocation.

### Categorization of logical fallacies

There is currently no accepted model for categorization or enumeratinon logical fallacies. (citation???) Note that (citation 1) enumerates X fallacies, while (citation 2) enumerates Y fallacies. (Can this statement be supported???)

According to the cortical tapestry model of knowledge representation and curation, one of the essential functions of the concept graph is to enumerate multiple definitions for any given word, phrase, concept or idea, and the central function of the grapevine is to pick one of them for any given context. From the viewpoint of this model, it shouold come as no surprise that equivocation would play a fundamental role in construction of toxic threads for use in construction of a narrative fiction.

### Equivocation network

Toxic tribal threaded tapestries typically contain multiple dishonest equivocations (DEs). A well formed narrative fiction contains multiple interlinking dishoonest equovactions. A useful exercise would be to map out the topology of DEs for a narrative fiction such as contemporary wokism. DEs will be arranged strategically in a way that it takes considerable effort to pin down the fallacy. Trying to do so becomes like a game of whack-a-mole.

Consider a tapestry with two DEs: DE_i and DE_j. Each DE contains two definitions: [DE_i_1, DE_i_2] and [DE_j_1, DE_j_2]. 

### Examples

TODO: take some standard logical fallacies and explain them in terms of equivocation.

### More in depth categorization

Equivocation can be used to create something that could be described as a *periodic table of logical fallacies*. (Can this idea be developed??)
