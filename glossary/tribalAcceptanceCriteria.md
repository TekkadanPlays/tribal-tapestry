tribal acceptance hypothesis
=====
(definitely need a new name for this!) proof of (tribal) allegiance?

The Tribal Tapestry hypothesis is based on the idea that a tribe can be defined in terms of its corresponding tribal narrative. This idea is not unique to the Tribal Tapestry model. Indeed, postmodernists and others have written about narratives and tribalism for years (same or similar ideas, even if not necessarily the exact same terminology). The thing that the TT adds to the conversation is the idea that proof of work is central to the formation of the tribal narrative. 

The basic idea is that the act of weaving the tribal tapestry into one's brain must necessarily come at an expense; that cognitive expense is incurred due to the incorporation of `toxic threads` into the tribal narrative; that demonstration of having incurred this expense is required for acceptance by the tribe; and that specialized words and actions known as `virtue signaling` are used as proof of having incurred that expense. 

Most individuals who encounter this hypothesis either reject or ignore it. Why? Because the most basic toxic thread, termed the `fundamental toxic thread`, common to most if not all tribal tapestries, is that toxicity is an attribute of *their* tribes -- the Other -- but never *our* tribe. 

Rejection: upon hearing this hypothesis for the first time, one's first reaction is typically to provide one or more alternate explanations for why toxicity is such a prevalant part of all human thought. People are flawed, people make mistakes but it's because we're not omniscent, anything other than that we adopt toxicity on purpose.

Ignore: Remarkably, most individuals who encounter this hypothesis are unable to repeat it a short time later. (Anecdotal observation. Ought to test this by a formal study.) The tribal tapestry explanation for this observation is that the tribal acceptance hypothesis fits firmly into the cognitive blond spot of virtually all individuals (a result of adoption of the `fundamental toxic thread`), which means that individuals simply have a hard time understanding this hypothesis. In typical blind spot fashion, it simply gets erased from long term memory.
