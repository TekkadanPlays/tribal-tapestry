ALtruism
=====

Altruism in one form or another is the most common glue used to bind together a narrative fiction. It may be defined as the `core contradiction` of the narrative fiction.

There are many variations on the notion of altruism. Christianity, Marxism, both state in one form or another that altruism is good and that selfishness is bad. Kant identifies altruism as a moral imperative. (Citataion?) The rejection of this core tenet by Ayn Rand, author of the book The Virtue of Selfishness, may best be understood as a rejection not of this specific idea, but rather a more general rejection of logical contradictions due to the resulting reduction in functioning of the mind.

There arw two reasons for this: 

### Core contradiction

Narrative fictions require toxic threads. Strongest way to create a toxic thread is logical inconsistency. The purest form of logical inconsistency would be something along the lines of: X = !X. Something equals its opposite. At their core, narratives concern themselves with purpose, values. ALtruism can be interpreted as the statement that one individual's purpose is equal *by definition* to the purpose of the tribe, or at least to other individuals in the tribe. Of course, this is not the definition of purpose. We thushave two, competing, incompatible definitions of purpose; hence the basis for logical internal contradiction.

### service to the tribe

Aside from the foundation of the narrative fiction (above), in some cases the tribe may benefit from convincing individuals to sacrifice themselves in servide to the tribe, provided that they do not, by dying, squander themselves in the process.
