Equivocation
=====

`Equivocation` is defined as vacillation between competing definitions of words, phrases or concepts.

There are two categories of equivocation: `honest equivocation` and `dishonest equivocation`. These may be understood and recognized primariy by the purposes that they serve.

### honest equivocation

Primary purpose: more accurate understanding of the world, and/or an improved ability to communicate thereof.

An improved understanding of the world is often accompanied by updates or revisions to existing terminology, if not the outright creation of new terminology.

### dishonest equivocation

Primary purpose: in service to the narrative fiction.

The contradiction at the core of a toxic thread (often communicated in the form of a virtue signal) can be recognized when a single word, phrase, or concept is given more than one definition, and when, in the course of a single argument or line of reasoning, there is a shift from one definition to another.

X is good (or bad); appeal to definition 1

A is an example of X; appeal to definition 2

Therefore A is good (or bad).

Example: Racism is bad. All white people are racist.

Definition 1: the act of rendering judgement over people based on race in spite of evidence to the contrary
Definition 2: the fact of benefitting from someone doing the above

To the leftist, the shift from definition to the other is justified, becasue the one implies the other. Which would be like saying that
