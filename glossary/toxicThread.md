toxic thread
====

In the context of the tapestry model, toxicity is a property of threads (or more broadly, of any subset or patch of a graph) which contain imperfections that are the genesis of `cognitive work`: either to reduce or remove the imperfection, or to maintain in some (unstable) state. There are two broad categories:

- assertions of fact which are unfalsifiable or demonstrably incorrect
- logical inconsistencies

Philosophical aside:  Alfred Jules Ayer might use the terms synthetic vs a priori to refer to these two categories. One category refers to statements of the outside universe; the other refers to statements about the language, the symbols used to represent of the universe. One requires sense-data, observation to test; the other requires only internal reflection. 

(Technically speaking, I would add that the latter is in fact a subset of the former; the statement that "A is a symbol that represents X" is in fact a falsifiable statement.)
