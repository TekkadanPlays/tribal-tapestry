toxic thread
====

In the context of the tapestry model, toxicity is a property of threads (or more broadly, of any subset or patch of a graph) which contain imperfections that are the genesis of `cognitive work`: either to reduce or remove the imperfection, or to maintain in some (unstable) state. There are two broad categories:

- assertions of fact which are unfalsifiable or demonstrably incorrect
- logical inconsistencies

Philosophical aside:  Alfred Jules Ayer might use the terms synthetic vs a priori to refer to these two categories. One category refers to statements of the outside universe; the other refers to statements about the language, the symbols used to represent of the universe. One requires sense-data, observation to test; the other requires only internal reflection. 

(Technically speaking, I would add that the latter is in fact a subset of the former; the statement that "A is a symbol that represents X" is in fact a falsifiable statement.)

# definition, restated

A *toxic thread* is a thread (belief, value, etc) which engenders opposing value judgments in US than it does in THEM. The definition of toxic does not require a thread to *be* unfalsifiable or logical inconsistent; it requires that OUTSIDERS judge that to be so. The definition, therefore, must always be made with reference to a specific tribal narrative. In the same sense that distance makes no sense in the absence of a frame of reference, likewise toxicity makes no sense in the absence of a referential tribal narrative. When communicating a distance, the frame of reference must always be specified (implicitly or explicitly, but without ambiguity). Likewise when denoting a thread as toxic, the tribal narrative must always be specified, without ambiguity.

There are tribal narratives which hold that certain unverifiable assertions are nevertheless true (and should be taken on faith); other tribal narratives which hold that objective reality does not exist (some variations of postmodernist thought); yet other narratives which hold that the universe is a simulation and we are, in a sense, a brain in a jar. All of these threads would count as toxic. Nevertheless, the Tribal Thead model does NOT require you to either accept, or to reject, any of these narratives. This is an important point to make.
