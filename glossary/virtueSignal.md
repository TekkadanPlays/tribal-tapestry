Virtue Signals
====

According to the TTT model, ` virtue signal` is a test designed to differentiate members who are loyal to a particular tribe from those who are not. 

## Basic methodology 

The basic function of the virtue signal is to test for the presence or absence of the [tribal tapestry](./tribalTapestry.md) within the individual

## Anatomy of the virtue signal 

## Test result

Binary: member or not; with a magnitude, indicating how well the test is passed (or how strongly it was failed). Think of the result as a value which is an integer and can be either positive or negative.

## Who devises the test? Motivation behind the test

In some cases, a virtue signaling test may be devised and used by members of a tribe who wish to distinguish insiders from outsiders. At first glance, one may think this is always the case. However, it is more often the case that individuals are the ones who subject themselves to the VS test. Their purpose being to broadcast their loyalty to other members of the tribe. Keep in mind that for most individuals, the need for oneself to belong to the group is a more pressing and urgent need, and takes precedence over, the desire to exclude others. 

Thus, the drivers/instigators/creators of the test tend to be individuals who wish to subject themselves to the test. However, in times of tribal stress, the incidence of aggressive testing of others may be observed. Although typically, the act of subjecting someone else to a VS test is likely more fundamentally driven by a need to belong than a desire to exclude. (Unless one is e.g. trying to take down a political opponenent.)

Motivation: the desire to belong vs the desire to exclude others; perhaps the latter is best understood as a derivative of the former?
