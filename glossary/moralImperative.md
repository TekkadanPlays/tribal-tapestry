Moral Imperative
===
a.k.a.: fundamental need, driving need

In TTT, the `moral imperative` is defined as the drive to belong to a tribe; to be accepted by a tribe of other individuals. Indeed, tribal threaded tapestry theory may be defined as the set of ramifications flowing from the fundamental need of an individual to belong to a tribe. 

The evolutionary justification of the moral imperative is that its absence usually results in death.
