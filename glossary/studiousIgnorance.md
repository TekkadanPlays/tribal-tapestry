studious ignorance
=====

*Studious ignorance*, a.k.a. *studied ignorance*, is one of the two basic categories of methods for justification of toxicity within one's narrative, the other category being *rationalization*.

As a general rule, studious ignorance of the inherent toxicity inherent to a virtue signal, or to the tribal narrative in general, is the preferred method given that it takes less cognitive effort to ignore a problem such as a logical inconsistency than to deal with it.
