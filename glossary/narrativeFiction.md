narrative fiction
=====

In the context of the tribal tapestry model, the narrative fiction corresponds to the set of threads which are `toxic`.

Iain McGilchrist, Ways of Attending, p 3:
*the uniqueness of the work, which lay in these very same much-valued qualities, seemed to consist only of imperfections.*

The tribal tapestry model, the reason imperfections are at the core of the tribal narrative is the requisite work involved in the integration of imperfections. See `proof of work`.
