narrative fiction
=====

In the context of the tribal tapestry model, the narrative fiction corresponds to the set of threads which are [toxic](./toxicThread,md)`.

Iain McGilchrist, describing his study of literature and his realization that "the things we prized about the work" of a great piece of literature "turned to a handful of dust" upon close inspection, Ways of Attending, p 3:
*... the uniqueness of the work, which lay in these very same much-valued qualities, seemed to consist only of imperfections.*

His explanation (which is what?) is true but incomplete, so much so that it misses the essential point [1]. The tribal tapestry model, the reason imperfections are at the core of the tribal narrative is the requisite work involved in the integration of imperfections. See `proof of work`.

[1] By way of analogy: when asked to explain the reason that an airplane fell to the grpund and blew up in flames, one might offer up "gravity" as the explanation. This explanation would not be incorrect. But it would be incomplete, and would miss the more salient, relevant, useful explanation (e.g. that the engines fell off).
