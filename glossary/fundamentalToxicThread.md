fundamental toxic thread
=====

According to tribal tapestry theory, the `fundamental` or `essential` or `primary toxic thread` is the notion that tribal acceptance criterion (need a better name for that) does not apply to one's own tribe, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. In other words, the TAC applies to virtually all tribes *except for one's own tribe* (and perhaps for allied tribes). One's own tribe is characterized by the rejection of all toxic threads. 

The `fundamental` or `essential` or `primary blind spot` refers to the relative inability to detect (or decreased sensitivity to) toxicity within one's own tribal narrative, as contrasted with the hightened sensitivity to toxicity within non-affiliated tribes, especially "enemy" tribes.
