a.k.a. `tribal narrative`, `tribal tapestry`
-----

In the context of Tribal Tapestry model, a narrative is a typically (although not universally) vast collection of elements:
- stories
- values
- beliefs
- concepts
- language
- customs
- expectations
- (more?)

The [narrative fiction](./narrativeFiction.md) is a subset of the narrative. The various elements of any given narrative can 

Each of the above elements is encoded into a tribal tapestry using the methods of the `concept graph` and the `grapevine`.

Generally speaking, there is a one-to-one correspondence between a tribal narrative and a tribe, with the tribal narrative being the salient feature to distinguish tribal members from outsiders.

Just as tribes can vary in size, overlap, and change over time, so too can tribal narratives do the same. Although they are not technically synonymous (membership in a tribe is defined as acceptance by other tribal members), it is usually the case that internalization of the tribal narrative is the most important prerequisite for membership in the tribe. Of course, this is not always the case; tribes that only admit individuals of a particular race, sex, or some other immutable characteristic being the chief counterexample. 

### Formation of the narrative

Why do some narratives remain static for long periods of time while others undergo rapid changes? 

Intertribal competition vs intratribal conmpetition. We postulate that periods of intense intratribal competition may be reflected in a rise in `virtue signaling`, the result of which can be rapid changes in the narrative, and in particular, the `narrative fiction`.

### Who decides the narrative?

It is generally considered an emergent phenomenon, akin to a flock of birds deciding what direction to fly. Although some individuals will have more influence on the narrative than others, it is not necessarily the case that any one individual possesses the ability or the influence to dictate, unilaterally, the nature of the tribal narrative. Even the most influential members, at any given time, will be limited as to what alterations they can make. Attempts to alter the narrative in the wrong way may result in loss of influence.
