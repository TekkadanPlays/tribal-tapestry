narrative
=====
a.k.a. `tribal narrative`, `tribal tapestry`
-----

In the context of Tribal Tapestry model, a narrative is a typically (although not universally) vast collection of elements:
- stories
- values
- beliefs
- concepts
- language
- customs
- expectations
- (more?)

Each of the above elements is encoded into a tribal tapestry using the methods of the `concept graph` and the `grapevine`.

Generally speaking, there is a one-to-one correspondence between a tribal narrative and a tribe, with the tribal narrative being the salient feature to distinguish tribal members from outsiders.

Just as tribes can vary in size, overlap, and change over time, so too can tribal narratives do the same. Although they are not technically synonymous (membership in a tribe is defined as acceptance by other tribal members), it is usually the case that internalization of the tribal narrative is the most important prerequisite for membership in the tribe. Of course, this is not always the case; tribes that only admit individuals of a particular race, sex, or some other immutable characteristic being the chief counterexample.
