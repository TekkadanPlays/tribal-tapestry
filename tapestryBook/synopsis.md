Synopsis
=====

In this groundbreaking, awe-inspiring, breathtaking, BRILLIANT IN ALL THE WAYS (lol) new book, Dr Strayhorn introduces his EPIC theory of what makes us all tick. He begins with his "Tapestry" model for how information is represented in the brain, a problem that has remained unsolved -- and perhaps even ignored -- up until now. With the Tapestry model as a starting point, he launches into a sprawling new view of human nature and what it means to be human.

Why are we all batshit crazy? What does it mean to belong to a tribe? How can we reap the benefits of our tribal mentality without degenerating into all the pathologic aspects of tribalism.
