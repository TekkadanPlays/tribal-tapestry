Synopsis
=====

In this groundbreaking, awe-inspiring, breathtaking, BRILLIANT IN ALL THE WAYS (lol) new book, Dr Strayhorn introduces his EPIC theory of what makes us all tick. He begins with his "Tapestry" model for how information is represented in the brain, a problem that has remained unsolved -- and perhaps even ignored -- up until now. With the Tapestry model as a starting point, he launches into a sprawling new view of human nature and what it means to be human.

Why are we all batshit crazy? What does it mean to belong to a tribe? How can we reap the benefits of our tribal mentality without degenerating into all the pathologic aspects of tribalism.

## new version

Why are the most captivating characters in literature and history full of contradiction? Why are we drawn to paradox? Dr Strayhorn posits an answer to these questions with a striking analogy to bitcoin's proof of work. The human condition is rooted in the fact that we are a sea of individuals who do not, and cannot, trust each other -- maybe some of us and some of the time, but not all of us, and not all of the time. We need allies, referred to in this book as tribes. Strayhorn's central thesis is that we demonstrate our allegiance to our tribes through a process called virtue signaling, through which we demonstrate the incorporation of tribal-specific beliefs, full of unproven or unprovable assertions, internal inconsistencies, parables and paradoxes, referred to in this work as toxic beliefs. The effect of the toxicity is that the internalization of these beliefs takes considerable work -- not by accident, but by design. Work that some may describe as cognitive; that others might call spiritual. And the amount of effort required at any given time self-adjusts, according to some (as-yet uncharacterized) algorithm, depending on the internal state (the degree of intra-tribal competition, or strife) of the tribe.

Despite the wasted cognitive energy, the spinning of the wheels, the damage such toxicity wreaks -- on the individual, on the tribe, and on the world as a whole -- there simply is no other way. Tribal toxicity, like bitcoin's PoW, is indispensible for the purpose that it serves. The question is not how to avoid it, but how best to implement it while minimizing the collateral damage. Read this book to find out how!
