Resistance is Futile
=====

For reasons that will become clear, there are several ideas that most readers will be inclined to resist. This is something I have observed in myself as I came up with these ideas as well as in others as I have attempted to explain them. As will become apparent, the theory itself predicts the use of logical fallacy to resist, reject and ultimately to ignore the general thrust of the argument of this book. In this chapter I will attempt to preempt as many of these logical fallacies as I can. To do this, I will list some of the objections that I have encoutered, in my own mind as well as in conversations with others.

### Objection #1: you can't expect human beings never to make an HONEST mistake

### Objection #2: you may be describing THEM, but not US and certainly not ME

### Objection #3: your explanation is wrong because the right explanation is _____

Fallacy: (name?)

Example: An airplane crashes. Alice: it crashed because the wings fell off. Bob: The REAL reason it crashed is because of GRAVITY. duh!! Therefore Alice's explanation is WRONG! (And can safely be ignored!)

In this book: the tribal narrative fiction exists. Alice: for the reasons stated in this book. Bob: no, it exists because greedy people lie to us. Therefore anything in this book that makes me uncomfortable (like the notion that we are all prone to self-deception) can be safely ignored.
