Hypotheses
=====

This is a summary of hypotheses that are introduced in this book

# The cortex is organized as a graph database

# The design of the database is determined in large measure by the need to solve the Primary Problem of decentralized, distributed systems

# class threads provide the essential structure. 

# In addition to class threads, additional major and minor criteria also exist to provide structure.

# There is a roughtly one to one correspondence between tribal threaded tapestries and tribes, with adoption of the narrative being the primary (mutable) criterion for acceptance by the tribe (not including immutable traits)

# Toxicity is actively incorporated into tribal narratives to make each narrative unique and to increase the cognitive cost of internalization of the narrative

# Equivocation as the building block for all Logical Fallacies
