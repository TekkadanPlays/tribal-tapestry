Summary of the Tapestry Model

# Introduction

This article is a brief overview of the `Threaded Tapestry Model for Knowledge Representation and Curation for Distributed, Decentralized Systems`, also referred to as the `Threaded Tapestry Model`, or simply the `Tapestry Model` (TM). I have been developing this model since about 2015 or 2016, continuing through to the present day. The primary motivation was, and continues to be, the development of open source tools for the creation of the decentralized web (dWeb). Over time, the neurologist in me began to speculate that the basic tools and methods that I am attempting to build for the dWeb may in fact already be at work in the brain. The rationale for this is that the dWeb (which is not yet been built, in my opinion) and the brain (which of course does already exist in nature) share the common feature of being distributed, decentralized systems. As such, they face a similar set of problems which may require a similar set of solutions. And it is the purpose of the Tapestry Model to provide those solutions.

In this paper I will present what exactly I mean by a `distributed, decentralized system` (DDS). I will describe the particular challenges faced by a DDS with respect to knowledge representation and curation. I will propose the Tapestry Model as a solution to this problem. In the context of the dWeb, the TM encompasses two techniques: one for knowledge representation and one for knowledge curation. I refer to the tools for knowledge representation as the `concept graph model`, according to which knowledge is encoded as a `graph database` and is organized into concepts by what I call `class threads`. I refer to the tools for knowledge curation as the `grapevine model`, designed to enable Alice to entrust curation of knowledge in a context-specific manner to her extended web of trust. Roughly speaking, the concept graph allows the enumeration of alternatives, and the grapevine allows us to choose among those alternatives.

The notion that information may be represented and curated in the brain in a manner similar to that of the Tapestry Model will be referred to as the Cortical Tapestry Model (CTM). Armed with the concept graph model of knowledge representation, it becomes simple and natural to speculate about some basic functions of the brain. For instance, we can begin to speculate in some detail not only how knowledge of the outside world may be stored within the graph, but also how social constructs, such as the definitions of words and concepts, may be encoded within the tapestry. We can begin to speculate at an information-theoretic level what it means for conflicting information or logical inconsistencies, called `toxic threads`, to exist within a tapestry, and to speculate simple heuristics that the brain could use to identify and resolve such conflicts.

Perhaps surprisingly, the Cortical Tapestry Model lends itself quite naturally to what I call the Tribal Tapestry Model. According to this model, any self-organizing group of individuals in a society, referred to as a `tribe`, is associated with, or even defined by, a `tribal narrative` (sometimes referred to as the `tribal tapestry`), shared by all members of the tribe, which is a collection of concepts, beliefs, stories and expectations, loosely knit together, encoded into the tapestry of each individual of the tribe according to the tenets of the tapestry model. This leads to the most highly speculative hypothesis of this work, which is the notion that `toxic threads` are an essential component of most if not all tribal tapestries. If true, this hypothesis will explain why it would seem that we are all, each and every one of us, `batshit crazy`. 

The shift between the TM and the CTM will require a shift in thinking from that of an engineer, trying to build something to solve a problemn, to that of a scientist, trying to uncover that which already exists in nature. The notion that the efforts of an engineer may inform the speculations of the scientist may seem to be a conceit of sorts. I am not aware of any historical precedent in the history of science. Ane yet, here I am. I will stress, therefore, that the hypotheses presented in this are all highly speculative. If they turn out to be wrong, I hope that at the very least, they will at least be interesting, and may provoke more ideas in a fruitful manner.
