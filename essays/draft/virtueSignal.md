Anatomy of the Virtue Signal
=====

Over the past several years, there seems to have been a gradually increasing awareness and concern among people of all political persuasions of what I will refer to in this essay as *pathologic tribalism*. There seems to be a vague unease that something is wrong with The System. But what is it, exactly? What is the problem? Or more importantly -- *who* is the problem?!? There seems to be no consensus on an answer to this question. Even those who would proffer a definitive answer are, sometimes inwardly, increasingly unsure of the narrative they seem to hold with such convistion. In this essay I will tender my own meta-analysis of this trend that we see, in the hopes that I may offer some actinonable insights. Maybe prevent society from running off the proverbial cliff.

I will begin with a definition of some basic ideas: tribe, tribalism, narrative, narrative fiction, and virtue signaling. Some of these terms and ideas are in common usage. Some, I am borrowing from postmodernists. But to a large extent, the terms and ideas are my own, based on observations and interactions with family, friends, and -- perhaps it should go without saying -- strangers on the internet. I will pay particular focus on a high level, abstract description of the phonomenon of virtue signaling, a phenomenon that (perhaps surprisingly to some) is not limited to any one particular political persuasion, segment of society, or tribe. It is my hope that by the end of this essay, the reader will be able to identify pathologic elements of the tribal narrative and of virtue signals, not only from the outside, but also from within one's own tribe. Societies must heal their tribal narratives from within. This begins with an awareness of what it is and why it exists in the first place.

For the sake of this essay, I will define a tribe as a group of people who are characterized by a common *tribal narrative*. A tribal narrative, in turn, is a (typically quite vast) collection of stories, ideas, thought patterns, beliefs, customs, values, and expectations that is shared by all members of the tribe. Tribes and their corresponding narratives can be large and stable over time -- think of religions with billions of members -- or small, fleeting, and rapidly changing, like a group of friends who get together on occasion. In the case of a small group, the narrative may be nothing more than a colleciton of implicit or explicit expectations about what we're doing and why (show up after work, no talking about the affair between Alice and Bob that we all know is happening) and perhaps flavored with a few inside jokes. In the case of a religion with billions of adherents and that has had hundreds or thousands of years to develop, the narrative is obviously much more vast than that. Tribes, and their corresponding narratives, can and do overlap: Christianity with Protestant vs Catholic; Ismal with Sunni and Shia; any given political party with multiple overlapping factions. These subtribes may or may not get along amicably. 

The first observation to make about any given tribal narrative is that all of its elements tend to hang together *loosely*, but it would seem, *never perfectly*. The tribal narrative can be envisioned as a tapestry, with each thread in the tapestry representing a different concept, custom, expectation, story, etc. Frequently, one thread will be entwined and supported by many others; a religious holiday, for example, that is rooted in one or more parables and stories, each of which threads in and of themselves. But it has been my observation that most -- perhaps all -- tribal narratives contain a small handful of narrative elements that an outsider would reject, all things being equal.
